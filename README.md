# Early-Detection-of-Breast-Cancer-Using-Spark-MLlib-and-its-Analysis

# Abstract

Breast cancer is causing widespread deaths and is one of the most common causes of cancers
encountered around the world. These deaths can be reduced by early detection of cancerous
cells. Unfortunately, not all physicians are experts in distinguishing between the benign and
malignant tumors and the classification of tumor cells may take up to two days.
We used the distributed computation framework of Hadoop - Apache Spark for quicker
analytics and faster model generations to aid in early detection of breast cancer. 

The analytic deals with the diagnosis of breast cancer by analyzing survey images of breast cancer cells and
raw text data consisting of characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the image to classify if the tumor cell being observed is benign or malignant.
